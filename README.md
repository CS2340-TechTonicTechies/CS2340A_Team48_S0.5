This is our android studio assignment. We learned how to use android studio as well as various
aspects of it such as the android lifecycle. 
# Android Assignment

In this assignment will be completing the implmentation of a basic fitness tracker app by filling in 8 different TODOs represting missing parts of a fully functionaly app. 

The app will have two Activities, `WellnessActivity` and a  `FitnessActivity`, that will correspond to a configuration tool for desired wellness metrics and a stopwatch tool, respectivley.

The project folder contains 8 TODOs in 5 different files:

`WellnessActivity.java` contains TODOs 1 and 3

`WellnessViewModel.java` contains TODO 2

`activity_wellness_dashboard.xml` contains TODO 4

`FitnessActivity.java` contains TODOs 5,6,7 

`ExampleUnitTest.java` contains TODO 8



Note that some of the TODOs (particulary the ones implementing Intents and Bundles) are dependedent on the implmentation in both of the Activities

Although it is not essential, you may want consider doing these TODOs in order as the concepts are somewhat sequential.

Please refer to the Android Tutorial videos posted to Canvas for implementation tips.

Here is a video displaying the correct functionality of the app that you should strive for: https://youtu.be/wkqQoSRT7y8
